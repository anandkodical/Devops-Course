Pre-requisites : Add a new HDD

Create swap partition (Primary)

1. Follow the same steps to make partition as mentioned below
    1. Run fdisk /dev/sdb
    2. Type n -> press enter  (for creating new partition)
    3. Type p -> press enter (primary partition)
    4. Type 2 -> press enter
    5. Press enter (Don't type anything for 1st cylinder)
    6. Type +2G for last cylinder and press enter
    7. Type W (for save and quit)
    8. Run lsblk (Now can see the 2GB partition called sdb2)
    9. Run mkswap /dev/sdb2
    10. Run blkid /dev/sdb2
Now we have created swap partition. Now we need to add this to system
    swapon -v /dev/sdb2
Now do swapon -s
swap memory is added in system. Run free  to check


Secondary swap partition

Create a secondary swap
    1. dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap24 bs=2M count=1 #if=input file, of=output file, /dev/zero is a null file, bs=block size, count=1, file will be created 1 file with 2MB (if count is 2 then 2 file will be created with 1MB each)
    2. du -sh /var/swap24
Now /var/swap24 file will be created as a secondary swap memory
Now we need to add this file to system
    mkswap /var/swap24
    swapon -v /var/swap24
    swapon -s
    free
swapoff /dev/sdb2
swapoff /var/swap24

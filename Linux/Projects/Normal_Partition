To add new HDD

Click on 'Player' in VM -> Manage -> Virtual Machine settings -> select Hard disk option -> Click Add -> Select Hard disk -> Next -> Next -> Select size 10GB -> Next -> Finish -> Ok
Note: This will add the HDD to server but it will not be detected automatically. We need to scan the hardware using below steps (alternatively, we can reboot server as well)
    
for ((i=0;i<=32;i++)
    do
    echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host$i/scan
done

Now run lsblk and you can see the new HDD called sdb (In 1 HDD, we can create maximum 4 partition)

Now we are going to make partition with 2GB
    1. Run fdisk /dev/sdb
    2. Type n -> press enter  (for creating new partition)
    3. Type p -> press enter (primary partition)
    4. Type 1 -> press enter
    5. Press enter (Don't type anything for 1st cylinder)
    6. Type +2G for last cylinder and press enter
    7. Type W (for save and quit) Q (for quitting without save)
    8. Run lsblk (Now can see the 2GB partition called sdb1)

Now we need to create a file system on the partition created so that we can use it
    1. mkfs.ext4  /dev/sdb1
    2. Now run blkid /dev/sdb1 you will get the entry confirms file system has been created on sdb1 partition

Now we need to create a directory in exiting partition and mount the new partition to this directory so that we can write to new partition
    1. mkdir /var/dec23
    2. mount /dev/sdb1 /var/dec23
    3. Now run df -h 

Now we need to check whether the files are saving in mounted partition
    1. cd /var/dec23
    2. ls -ltr
    3. touch t{1..5}
    4. umount /var/dec23 

Note: Can see the folder with "lost+found" which indicates this is mounted partition

Now create a new directory called dec24
    1. mount /dev/sdb1 /var/dec24 
    2. ls -ltr dec24
    3. lsof | grep /var/dec24

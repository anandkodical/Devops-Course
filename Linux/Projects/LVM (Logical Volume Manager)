LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a storage management method that allows you to manage disk space more flexibly and efficiently than normal partition. 
It provides a way to create, resize, and manage logical volumes without server downtime. 

There are few steps to create LVM

    1. Create Partition
    2. Create Physical Volume
    3. Add Physical Volume to  Volume Group
    4. Create LVM
    5. Create file system
    6. Mount file system
    7. Resizing

1. Create partition
    1. Run fdisk /dev/sdb
    2. Type n -> press enter  (for creating new partition)
    3. Type p -> press enter (primary partition)
    4. Type 2 -> press enter  (partition number)
    5. Press enter (Don't type anything for 1st cylinder)
    6. Type +2G for last cylinder and press enter
    7. Type W (for save and quit)
    8. Run lsblk (Now can see the 2GB partition called sdb2)

2. Create physical volume
    1. pvcreate /dev/sdb2
    2. Run pvs to see the physical volume created

3. Add physical volume to volume group
    1. vgcreate vg_dec25 /dev/sdb2
    2. Run vgs to check whether volume group created or not

4. Create LVM
    1. lvcreate -L 1G -n lv_dec25 vg_dec25
    2. Run lvs to check LVM is created or not.
         Note: LV path is /dev/vg_dec25/lv_dec25

5. Create file system
    1. mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_dec25/lv_dec25

6. Mount file system
   In order to mount the LVM, need to create a directory
   a. mkdir /var/lvmdec25
   b. mount /dev/vg_dec25/lv_dec25 /var/lvmdec25
   c. Run df -h and we can see /dev/mapper/vg_dec25/lv_dec25 row. This confirms this is LVM partition and not normal partition

7. Resizing
    1. lvresize -L +1G /dev/vg_dec25/lv_dec25
    2. Run lvs to check the LVM size

After these steps, we have created and resized the LVM but it's not yet recognized by the kernal. In order to inform the kernal
    resize2fs /dev/vg_dec25/lv_dec25
Now run df -h and we can see the LVM with 2GB

Extending LVM if the storage is full.

    1. Create a new partition
    2. Create a physical group
    3. vgextend vg_dec25 /dev/sdb3
    4. Run vgs, can see total 7GB
        Now attach the 5GB to existing LVM
    5. lvresize -L +5G /dev/vg_dec25/lv_dec25
    6. resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg_dec25/lv_dec25

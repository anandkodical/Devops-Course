Title: SSH Key-Based Authentication Setup

Prerequisites:

  => Linux systems for both server and client.
  => Root or sudo access for configuration.
  => Basic understanding of SSH protocol

Updates to Be Done on Server 1:
  1. Generate SSH key pair:
      ssh-keygen -t rsa
      Save the key pair (default path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
      
  2. Copy the public key to the Server 2:
      scp id_rsa.pub user@<server_IP>:~   (This will copy the file to users home directory)

Updates to Be Done on Server 2:

  1. Go to users home directory
  2. mkdir .ssh
  3. mv id_rsa.pub .ssh/
  4. chmod 700 .
  5. mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
  6. chmod 640 authorized_keys

Now we can access the server 2 from server 1 without authentication.

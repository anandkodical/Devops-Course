**RPM (Redhat Package Manager)**

RPM is a package management system used in RedHat, Ubuntu CentOS etc. It allows users to install, update, query, and remove software packages. 
In order to get the packages, we will need to mount RedHat ISO file and make a copy in different path.

    mount -o loop RHEL6.3-20120613.2-Server-x86_64-DVD1.iso /var/rpm_dec25

Now the packages will be saved under /var/rpm_dec25/Packages

Since this is mounted directory, it will get deleted once unmount or the RHEL file gets deleted. To resolve this will need to make a copy of the packages to local directory.

    Yes|cp -rvfp /var/rpm_dec25 /var/yum_dec25

Now update the configuration file under /etc/yum.repos.d/master.repo (Letting kernal know to the packages from this path for installation of packages)

    [MASTER]
    name=master
    baseurl=file:///yum_dec25/rpm_dec25
    enabled=1  
    gpgcheck=0

Now we can confirm whether all packages are recognizing or not by rum clean all and yum repolist

**CCNA Basics**

**Operating system** : It's a collection of programs that allows users to communicate with the device/computer. Program is known as collection of instructions to perform users tasks.

**Computer** : **C**ommonly **O**perated **M**achine **P**articularly **U**sed for **T**rade, **E**ducation and **R**esearch.

  Motherboard is called as Heart of the computer since it connects all input and output devices with it.

**Software** :

Set of instructions that are used to interacts with hardware device as per users requirement.

**Types of software:-**

    1. System software: Interface between user and hardware of the computer. Ex: Operating system

    2. Utility software: Acts as a interface between hardware and system software. Ex: Device drivers

    3. Application software: General applications which will be communicated with OS. Ex: paint, VLC etc

**Types of Operating System**

    1. **Server Operating system** : A server operating system is software that helps a computer function as a server, meaning it can manage, store, and deliver data to other computers on a network. It's designed to handle multiple users, manage large amounts of data, and ensure that services (like websites, applications, and databases) are always available and secure. Examples include Windows Server, Linux-based systems like Ubuntu Server, and macOS Server.

    2. **Client Operating system** : A client operating system is software that runs on personal computers or devices that people use to access information and applications from a server. It's designed for everyday tasks, like browsing the internet, creating documents, playing games, and running apps. Examples include Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.

In Server OS, web services will come along with the server which is called as IIS and in linux it's knpwn as Apache. softwares in linux called as packages.

**Memory**

There are 2 types of memory.

  1. Primary/Volatile memory : These are faster in speed but low in capacity. Ex: RAM and ROM

  2. Secondary/non volatile memory : These are large capacity but slow in speed. Ex: HDD, USB etc

Components of HDD : Platter, Actuator, Actuator arm, read/write head, Spindle, Power cable, jumper.


**Formatting :-**

There are 2 types of formatting.

  1. Low level formatting : These are predefined by the manufacturer. Ex : Pendrive, memory cards

  2. High level formatting: Can customize as per the user requirements. Ex: HDD

Quick formatting: Only data will be erased.

Normal format :Data will be erased along with the sectors and tracks.

MBR : Master Boot Record 

  It's a methodology of partition. It contains the information such as,

      Data capacity

      Size of partition

      OS partition

      It has 512 byte size

      This will be selected by the OS since it can manage upto 2TB of disk.

      Not flexible and can make only maximum of 4 partition

GPT : GUID Partition Table

    This is having 512 byte size

    Can make upto 128 partition since it can handle more than 2TB

    This methodology is used nowadays

**Networking**

  Networking is group of 2 or more computers.

  Connected using transmission media with wires or wireless.

  Used to share the resources like files, folders and other data.

  **Types of networking:-**

      1. LAN (Local Area Network) 

      2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

      3. WAN (Wide Area Network)

      4. CAN (Campus Area Network)

      5. PAN (Personal Area Network)

  **Types of network access :-**

    1. WorkGroup : No centralazed control such as personal computer or laptop.

    2. Domain based : This is managed by the centralized control such as organization or office network.

Authentication : Identify the user identity

Authorization : Network/device access.


**Types of cables:-**

  1. Twisted pair cable : This is called as copper cable which is used to transmit the data.

  2. Co-axial cable: These are high thinkness cables which is used in TV

  3. Fibre optic cable : These are costly when compared to other cables which are transmitting light signals.


Twisted pair cables.

    - Have 4 color pairs

    - Orange, Green, Blue and brown

    - ABove 4 colors will be in combination as white/orange, orange, white/green, green, white/brown, brown, white/blue, blue

    - These are used in LAN cables along with the RJ-45 connector (8 pin).

    - 4 pin cables are used in old landline phones using RJ-11 connector.


**Tools needed for crimping**

  1. Cable

  2. RJ-45 connector

  3. crimping tool

  4. Wire cutter

  5. Cabke tester

  6. Understanding of connectivity


**Types of cables:-**

**1. Straight through cables**

These cables are used to connect the straight devices such as switches=>Router=>Computer. The color combinations is given below.

    **Side A**                        **Side B**

    1. white-orange                1. White orange

    2. Orange                      2. Orange

    8. Brown                       8. Brown

In this connection both sides of the cables which are connected using the RJ-45 connector will be same color combination.


**2. Cross over cables:-**

These cables are used to connect the similar or same devices. Ex: Router to router, computer to computer. The color combination is given below.

**Orange color**: Used to transmit the data

**Green color**: Used to receive data


**ROUTER**:-  The main difference here is that a L3 switch can not perform external routing , whereas a router is the only device that is capable of performing external routing.

**ROUTING**:-  PERFORMING NETWORK COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT NETWORK.

 **L3**:- is capable of performing internal routing .

**IP Address - Internet Protocol**

Protocol - Set of rules which enables us to communicate on a network.
Intranet - Same network (communication)
Internet - Different network
